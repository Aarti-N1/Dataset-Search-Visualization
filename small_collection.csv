Using the fact that in some countries production virtually shuts down for one summer month, together with the differences in the timing of aggregate cyclical fluctuations, information is provided on the cost structure of different industries. A number of previously documented patterns can be confirmed. In particular, a tremendous amount of volatility in production is accounted for by seasonal shifts, but the seasonal shifts are not very highly correlated across countries. There are also considerable differences in the timing and magnitude of business cycles across countries. Lastly, the country-level differences in seasonality are larger that the industry-level patterns in seasonality. In addition to these basic observations, a number of new results describing how seasonal production patterns vary over the course of the business cycle are provided. Wit
h the exception of textiles, and to a lesser extent transportation equipment and chemicals, the seasonal cycle in production is significantly less volatile during a business cycle boom than it is during a business cycle contraction. For one-third of the 19 countries in our sample, there are significant cyclical/seasonal interactions common to all industries within the country. In relative terms, the estimated interactions that are common to countries are larger than the interactions that are common to industries. This is in line with the finding that the overall variation in production differs more across countries that it does across industries. Finally, the reallocation of production from high output months to low output months that typically occurs in moving from a business cycle through to peak is sometimes quite large.",

The failure to link the two levels of analysis leaves a gap in our collective understanding of the dynamics of aggregate partisanship. To remedy this, a set of ideal types are identified in this collection that capture the essential arguments made about individual-level party identification. The behavioral assumptions for each ideal type are then combined with existing results on statistical aggregation to deduce the specific temporal pattern that each ideal type implies for aggregate levels of partisanship. Using new diagnostic tests and a highly general time series model, the investigators found that aggregate measures of partisanship from 1953 through 1992 are fractiona
lly integrated. The evidence that the effects of a shock to aggregate partisanship last for years -- not months or decades -- challenges previous work by party systems theorists (e.g., Burnham, 1970) and students of ""macropartisanship"" (e.g., MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson, 1989). The arguments and empirical evidence of the degree of persistence in macro-level partisanship provides a conceptually richer and empirically more precise basis for existing theories -- such as those of issue evolution (Carmines and Stimson, 1989) or endogenous preferences (Gerber and Jackson, 1993) -- in which partisanship plays a central role.",

Using Achen's (1986) framework of quasi-experiments, the  model includes dynamic ""assignment equations"" and ""outcome  equations,"" which address the problem of nonrandom assignment.

Often when a decision  is made is as critical as the decision itself. The principal  investigators (PIs) posit a dynamic model of strategic position  announcement, based in part on signaling theories of legislative  politics. Specifically, they suggest that members who receive s
trong,  clear signals from constituents, interest groups, and policy leaders,  that do not conflict with their own personal preferences about which  position to take, will announce their positions earlier. Those with  weak or conflicting signals will seek more information from those same  constituents, interest groups, and policy leaders, delaying their  position announcement. The PIs test a number of these expectations by  examining data on when members of the United States House of  Representatives announced their support for or opposition to the North  American Free Trade Agreement. They also contrast the effects of  explanatory variables in the dynamic timing model with those of the  vote model, and find that a richer specification of the form of the  variables, interactions, and a larger set of variables explain the  timing decision. The research thus allows  analysts to interpret both the process leading up to the House action and the end state of that process."

This research examines the relationship  between states' Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)  payments and teen birthrates. Drawing on rational choice theories, the  investigators expected the effects of states' AFDC payments on their  teen birthrates to be positive, taking unemployment rates, racial  composition, and poverty rates into account. The effects of states'  AFDC payments were significant in a negative direction in Model 1, a  random effects model. They also were significant in
a negative  direction in Model 2 when the effects of year were controlled  for. However, when the effects of year and state in Model 3 were  controlled for, they were not significant. The findings do not support  assumptions regarding the incentive effects of welfare that underlie  rational choice theories in states where teen birthrates are  higher. If anything, teen birthrates are higher in states where AFDC  payments are lower. Implications for policy and further research are  discussed in relation to the positive effects of states' poverty and population change rates on the state teen birthrate problem."

The principal investigators hypothesize that ethnopolitial groups that produce residuals below the regression line will likely exhibit rebellious behavior in the early 1990s. They use a three-stage least squares estimator, analyze the coefficients and standard errors, and also examine the residuals. The PIs find broad support for the theoretical synthesis, but focus attention on the risk assessments. In addition to identifying ethnopolitical groups that did resort to greater violence in the early 1990s, the theoretical model helps to explain why a number of groups that the analysis suggested would rebel in the early 1990s have not, in fact, done so."

Consistent with narrative accounts, factor analysis identifies the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the war in Lebanon as the two most important features of the data. Other factors re
flect inter-Arab and major-power relationships. Discriminant analysis can distinguish a set of human-coded phases with about 90 percent accuracy. Stepwise discriminant achieves 70 percent accuracy using data from only 12 of the 54 directed dyads. Finally, K-means cluster analysis identifies five distinct phases that align fairly well with the human-coded phases, particularly in the first half of the time period. The dataset consists of WEIS-coded events generated from Reuters lead sentences downloaded from the NEXIS data service, then coded using the Kansas Event Data System (KEDS) machine coding system. One file provides the raw event data (approximately 110,000 events). A second tab-delimited file aggregates these events into dyad-months using the Goldstein (1992) scaling. The KEDS coding dictionaries and the program used to generate the data are also included in the ICPSR Publication-Related Archive release.

Indexation is assured by  institutions and contract provisions that protect people against the  effects of unanticipated inflation, as measured by a consumer price  index or similar index. Examples of institutions that promote  indexation are cost of living allowances, escalator clauses, or  inflation-protected bonds. Subjects were interviewed to understand  their lack of interest in indexation. Questionnaire surveys were  administered in the United States and in Turkey (where inflation rates  are much higher and where there is still little indexation) in  1996. Many causes of this lack of interest in indexation are studied,  prominent among them being lack of appreciation of inflation  uncertainty, lack of trust in the government, and beliefs that high  inflation, if it were to come, would coincide with times of economic and political instability."

These norms arise from, and are influenced by, the behaviors of the  individual justices, including the actions of the Chief Justices. In  turn, they cause concurrences and dissents to fluctuate around a  common level. If consensual norms are a substantial influence on the  behavior of the Court, the long-run extent of concurrence and dissent  on the Court will covary substantially, and will do so to varying  degrees under different Chief Justices. To test their hypotheses, the  authors used cointegration and error-correction analyses of the  number of Supreme Court cases with concurring and dissenting opinions,  from 1800 to 1991. Because of the dramatic
increase in concurrences  and dissents during the 1940s, they made use of recently-developed  methods for detecting cointegrating relationships in the presence of  structural breaks. Consistent with expectations, dissents and  concurrences moved together over time. Thus consensual norms appeared  to influence substantially both concurrences and dissents on the  Court. The effects of such norms vary in the long term under different Chief Justices."

It is conceivable that the United States stock market crashed because it was expected to crash. To test this hypothesis, transaction prices of Standard and Poor's 500 futures options over the 1985-1987 period were examined for evidence prior to October 1987 of expectations of an impending crash. It was found that out-of-the-money puts became unusually expensive during the year leading up to the crash. A model was therefore derived for pricing American options on jump-diffusion processes with systematic jump risk. The jump-diffusion parameters implicit in option prices indicate
that a crash was expected and that implicit distributions were negatively skewed for the October 1986-August 1987 period. Neither approach, however, points to any strong crash fears in the two months prior to the crash."

Data going back to the 19th  century show that the most recent inflation/disinflation cycle is a  repetition of earlier long mone
tary growth and inflation cycles in the  United States historical record. Also discussed is a measure of bond  market inflation credibility, defined as the difference between  averages in long-term bond rates and real GDP growth. By this measure,  inflation credibility hovered close to zero during the 1950s and early  1960s, but then rose to a peak of about 10 percent in the early  1980s. During the 1990s, the bond market has yet to restore the low  inflation credibility that existed before inflation turned up during  the 1960s. The conclusion is that the risks of starting another costly  inflation/disinflation cycle could be avoided by monitoring monetary  growth and maintaining a sufficiently tight policy to keep inflation  low. An environment of credible price stability would allow the  economy to function unfettered by inflationary distortions, which is  all that can reasonably be expected of monetary policy, and is precisely what should be expected."

Primarily because western states tend to be more dependent on East Asian markets for export sales, they were hit the hardest by the sharp reduction in Asian demand for United States-produced manufactured goods. Of the states in which the decline in exports to East Asia lowered the growth of manufacturing output by more than 1 percent, two-thirds were western states. The export changes caused by the Asian crisis, however, were found to matter little for manufacturing employment growth across states
during 1998. Meanwhile, states with a high concentration of manufacturing industries that use petroleum products extensively as an input tended to have larger manufacturing employment increases during 1998 than other states. Consequently, the authors conclude that the oil price declines during late 1997 and 1998, some portion of which can be attributed to the Asian crisis, appear to be more important than the export effects in influencing manufacturing employment across states."

Their success in finding apparently robust, stable relationships in both long- and short-run data led monetarists to apply long-run propositions to short-run policy questions, effectively competing with alternative views of the time.

Through the use of such  software, hundreds of banks have sharply reduced the amount of their  required reserves.

This article shows that the answer to this question depends on who actually makes business decisions in credit unions (who is in control), and whether local deposit market competition is important. It is not obvious who controls occupational credit unions. If the sponsor (the employer) is in control, then loans and deposits are priced to maximize the surplus received by all of the credit union's current and potential members (those eligible to join). If members are in control, then a group of members with a majority can maximize its own surplus. The group in control may include members whose primary purpose for joining the credi
t union is to borrow money or, alternatively, to lend money (make deposits). If local deposit-market competition is the dominant influence, then internal characteristics of the credit union won't matter at all. This study tests the sponsor-control, the member-control, and the market-control hypotheses against each other using a large sample of occupational credit unions observed in 1997. The results suggest that sponsors exercise effective control over occupational credit unions."

The  efficient allocation of control is a necessary condition for the  optimal allocation of resources. Dynamic efficiency in resource  allocation presupposes that control over firms will change hands when  a given allocation becomes suboptimal. Typically, changes in control  are brought about through (successful) tender offers or block  trades. With regard to takeovers, a firm may have two types of value  to consider: First, there is the public value of the firm, which is  the market value of the firm's securities. Second, there may be a  private value of the firm. The private value is the benefit an  investor enjoys from exercising control over the firm. Private control  benefits are most significant for entrepreneurial start-ups, for  established family-owned businesses, and for organizations in whic

Of the legal arrangements  identified in the finance literature, the most significant for wealth  maximization in takeovers are the one share-one vote principle,  majority rule, and mandatory tender offers.

Misspecified VARs  that fail to account for discrete target changes imply the policy  innovation paradox, whereas a model that uses information from discrete policy changes does not."

After constructing alternative measures of investment spending that are adjusted for quality change that may go unmeasured in the official

amines the economic issues underlying the  regulation and provision of aviation security. The fact that security  at one airport can affect the well-being of those at other airports  and elsewhere, an example of a network externality (spillover),  provides an economic justification for governmental involvement in  aviation security. A fundamental question is whether the federal role  should be restricted to setting and monitoring security standards or  whether the role should also include the financing and implementation  of security. A controversial change is that the federal government has  assumed responsibility from the airlines and airports for the actual  provision of aviation security. Proponents of this change argue that,  relative to private provision, public provision reduces the incentives  to reduce quality through cost reductions. On the other hand, a  public agency might not provide security services efficiently because  it can operate in a more-or-less monopolistic way. Furthermore, a  public agency might provide an excessive amount of security and incur  unnecessary expenses because it is likely to be judged on its security  record and not on all the attributes encompassed by air transportation  services for consumers. Thus, economic theory does not provide a clear  answer to what is likely to be a continuing source of controversy --  the appropriate scope of governmental involvement in aviation security."

Several explanations have been  offered, from the acceleration in labor productivity -- the so-called  ""New Economy"" story -- to the stock market surge and subsequent  collapse. One explanation that has not been explored in much detail
is  the surge in business purchases of hardware and software in  preparation for the century data change (Y2K). Because many  information processing systems and much of the hardware and software  were not Y2K-compliant as late as 1998, it was thought that business  investment in high-tech equipment and software would increase  appreciably to fix this problem.

The distinction between ease of recalling events and judgments of their importance. Compound events which are composed of sub-events that can be remembered separately by respondents. And larger social and technological changes difficult or impossible to date with any precision. Panel data from the second and third surveys, obtained shortly before and after 9/11, aid in determining which earlier collective memories were superseded by the terrorist attack itself."

One often-neglected consequence of using a quarterly average of the daily federal funds rate in empirical work is that any change in the target federal funds rate will affect the quarterly average in the current quarter and the subsequent quarter. Despite this clear source of predictable change in the quarterly average of the federal funds rate, the vast bulk of the literature that estimates policy rules ignores information concerning the timing and magnitude of discrete changes to th

Consequently, policy equations that include interest rate smoothing inadvertently make the strong and unnecessary assumption that the starting point for interest rate smoothing is last quarter's average level of the federal funds rate.

Given that population growth and human capital growth are both positively associated with education, these results suggest that the geographic distributions of population and human capital should have become more concentrated in recent decades.

Respondents were polled on whether they were better   or worse off financially compared to three years ago, whether it was   more important to cut federal taxes or balance the federal budget,   and whether they supported middle class tax cuts, even if it meant   cutting spending on federal programs. Questions involving the   upcoming presidential election polled respondents on the likelihood   that they would vote, whom they would vote for (President Bill   Clinton, Republican Bob Dole, or Reform Party candidate Ross Perot),   whether each candidate had the qualities needed to be an effective   president, the success of their political campaigns, and who the   Republican vice-presidential candidate should be. Opinions were   solicited on whether the presidential candidates had a vision for the   future of the country, had high moral and ethical standards, cared   about people like the respondent, had new ideas, and stood up for   what they believed in, and which one would do a better job handling   issues such as the economy, crime, the environment, and Medicare.   Respondents were queried on whether they would vote for a Democratic   or Republican candidate in the upcoming United States House of   Representatives election, whether they approved of the way the United   States Congress was doing its job, and whether Pat Buchanan should be   allowed to make a speech at the Republican convention. Respondents   were also asked which political party best represented their ideal of   how the United States should be governed, whether the views of each   party were too conservative or too liberal, whether respondents   supported Ross Perot's new Reform Party, and whether the country   needed a new political party. Views were also elicited on issues such   as a federal balanced budget amendment, the death penalty,   congressional term limits, gun control, organized prayer in public   schools, a flat-tax system, recent changes to the welfare system,   affirmative action, gay rights, and whether respondents would prefer   a smaller government with fewer services or a larger government with   many services. Several questions addressed whether abortion should be   legal, whether the Republican vice-presidential candidate should   support legal abortion, and whether the Republican platform should   support a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.

It evaluated the impact of work release  sentencing on recidivism and on corrections costs by comparing a  sample of inmates who participated in work release with a comparable  sample of inmates who completed their sentences in prison. The study  was designed to answer the following questions: (1) What are the  background and offense characteristics of offenders assigned to work  release in the Seattle area? (2) What types of services are received  by offenders in work release? and (3) How does the community  experience of work release participants compare to that of similar  offenders discharged directly into the Seattle community without  having gone through work release? For each offender, detailed  information was collected on measures relating to work release  participation and recidivism outcomes. Information was gathered from  Department of Corrections institutional files, work release program  records, computerized payment information for legal and financial  obligations, and statewide criminal history records.

Criminal Justice Research Division,"In 1988, with funds from the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) via the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1987, a multiagency task force, Jurisdictions Unified for Drug Gang Enforcement (JUDGE), was created. Spearheaded by the San Diego County District Attorney's Office and representing a unique blend of police officers, probation officers, and deputy district attorneys working together, the JUDGE program targeted documented gang members also involved in drug use and sales. The task force incorporated an intensive supervision approach that enforced conditions of probation and drug laws and provided vertical prosecution for probation violations and new offenses involving targeted offenders. This research project sought to address the following research objectives: (1) to determine if the JUDGE program objectives were met during the grant period, (2) to assess the results of program activities, such as surveillance, special enforcement, and vertical prosecution, in terms of probation violations, arrests, pretrial custody, probation revocations, convictions, and sentences, (3) to evaluate the impact of the program on offenders as measured by recidivism and the need for probation intervention, (4) to assess the cost of JUDGE probation compared to regular probation caseloads, and (5) to provide recommendations regarding the implementation of similar programs in other jurisdictions. This research project consisted of a process evaluation and an impact assessment that focused on the first two years of the JUDGE program, when youthful offenders were the targets (1988 and 1989). The research effort focused only on new targets for whom adequate records were maintained, yielding a study size of 279. The tracking period for targets ended in 1992. For the impact assessment, the research was structured as a within-subjects design, with the comparison focusing on target youths two years before the implementation of JUDGE and the same group two years after being targeted by JUDGE. Data were compiled on the juveniles' age at target, race, sex, gang affiliation, type of target (gang member, drug history, and/or ward), status when targeted, and referrals to other agencies. Variables providing data on criminal histories include age at first contact/arrest, instant offense and disposition, highest charges for each subsequent arrest that resulted in probation supervision, drug charges, highest conviction charges, probation conditions before selection date and after JUDGE target, number of contacts by probation and JUDGE staff, number of violations for each probation condition and action taken, and new offenses during probation. For the process evaluation, case outcome data were compared to project objectives to measure compliance in terms of program implementation and results. Variables include number of violations for each probation condition and action taken, and number of failed drug tests. The consequences of increased probation supervision, including revocation, sentences, custody time, and use of vertical prosecution, were addressed by comparing the processing of cases prior to the implementation of JUDGE to case processing after JUDGE targeting."

This evaluation of PIR was based on a quasiexperimental design that compared program activities and outcomes for two matched groups of high-risk probationers receiving different levels of service and supervision. The assessment included both a process evaluation to discover if expected service levels were implemented as designed, and an impact evaluation to assess the effectiveness of drug treatment within an intensive community supervision program. The experimental group included 209 PIR participants who received intensive community supervision and drug treatment, and the control group consisted of 151 probationers who were assigned to regular high-risk probation caseloads and who met the PIR screening criteria. The samples were selected from probationers entering community supervision from February to December 1991. The length of the PIR program varied, but for purposes of analysis the minimum time in the program to represent the intervention period was set at eight months, including relapse prevention. A comparable period was used for the control group. The subsequent six-month period was used to measure the effects of PIR and regular high-risk probation after intervention. Intake interviews were conducted with a subsample of 96 probationers in PIR and 80 in the control group (Part 1). The interviews were conducted within the first two weeks after intake. Follow-up interviews were conducted with these probationers after they had completed eight months of PIR or regular high-risk probation to measure experiences on probation and changes in behavior and attitudes (Part 2). Follow-up interviews were completed with 47 probationers from the experimental group in the PIR program and 35 in the control group. The case tracking portion of the study involved the review of probation, treatment, and state and local criminal history files (Part 3). Data on technical violations and arrests for new crimes were compiled for the following time periods: (1) six months prior to the instant offense (the baseline), (2) the first eight months of community supervision (the in-program period), (3) the six months after intervention, and (4) the combined 14-month period. The initial interview (Part 1) included questions regarding sociodemographic characteristics, current offense, awareness of probation conditions ordered, perceived consequences for violations of probation, drug use and drug history, prior drug treatment and treatment needs, c
riminal history, expectations regarding the probation term, opinions regarding probation and treatment, daily activities prior to the current offense, current life satisfaction, and prospects for the future. Questions on the follow-up interview (Part 2) focused on changes in probationers' personal lives (e.g., employment, income, education, marital status, living situation, and relationships with family and friends), technical probation violations and new offenses committed during the eight-month period, sanctions imposed by probation staff, contacts with probation and treatment staff, changes in drug use and daily activities, expectations with regard to remaining crime- and drug-free in the future, attitudes regarding probation and treatment, treatment needs, and significant life changes over the eight-month period. Variables in the tracking data file (Part 3) include sociodemographic characteristics, current offense and sentence imposed, probation conditions ordered, drug use history, offense and probation violations occurring before, during, and after an eight-month probation period, custody time, changes in level of probation supervision, and program interventions such as drug tests, services delivered, and sanctions imposed."

Day fines are a structured approach to imposing  fines that considers both the offender's ability to pay and the  severity of the offense. The program involves two steps: (1) a  determination of the number of fine units for an offense, based on the  severity of the offense, and (2) a valuation of fine units, based on  the offender's net daily income, hence the name ""day fines"". While  four jurisdictions participated in the day fines evaluation, only the  site in Maricopa County, Arizona, was structured in such a way to  allow for a quasi-experimental research design. Therefore, this  collection only contains data from the Financial Assessment Related to  Employability (FARE) day fines program in Maricopa County. The FARE  program was started in 1991 and targeted felony offenders with little  need for supervision or treatment -- in other words, the low risk-low  need defendant. The intent of the program was to draw clients from the  population of offenders who would traditionally receive routine  probation, thus serving as an intermediate sanction between routine  and summary probation. The major research strategy was to consider the  FARE-sentenced offenders as the experimental group and to construct a  similar comparison group out of the offenders sentenced by non-day  fines judges. The design involved three major steps: (1)  identification of 1991 and 1992 defendants who received a FARE  sentence, (2) screening of sentenced defendants in non-FARE courts  using FARE eligibility criteria to match the FARE participants, and  (3) coding background and 12-month follow-up information for both FARE  and comparison group offenders from probation and clerk files to  record background information, monetary payments, and any technical  violations and arrests occurring during the 12-month follow-up  period.

Department of Criminal Justice,"This study of violent incidents among middle- and  high-school students focused not only on the types and frequency of  these incidents, but also on their dynamics -- the locations, the  opening moves, the relationship between the disputants, the goals and  justifications of the aggressor, the role of third parties, and other  factors. For this study, violence was defined as an act carried out  with the intention, or perceived intention, of physically injuring  another person, and the ""opening move"" was defined as the action of  a respondent, antagonist, or third party that was viewed as beginning  the violent incident. Data were obtained from interviews with 70 boys  and 40 girls who attended public schools with populations that had  high rates of violence. About half of the students came from a middle  school in an economically disadvantaged African-American section of a  large southern city. The neighborhood the school served, which  included a public housing project, had some of the country's highest  rates of reported violent crime. The other half of the sample were  volunteers from an alternative high school attended by students who  had committed serious violations of school rules, largely involving  illegal drugs, possession of handguns, or fighting. Many students in  this high school, which is located in a large city in the southern  part of the Midwest, came from high-crime areas, including public  housing communities. The interviews were open-ended, with the students  encouraged to speak at length about any violent incidents in school,  at home, or in the neighborhood in which they had been involved. The  110 interviews yielded 250 incidents and are presented as text files,  Parts 3 and 4. The interview transcriptions were then reduced to a  quantitative database with the incident as the unit of analysis  (Part 1). Incidents were diagrammed, and events in each sequence were  coded and grouped to show the typical patterns and sub-patterns in  the interactions. Explanations the students offered for the  violent-incident behavior were grouped into two categories: (1)  ""justifications,"" in which the young people accepted responsibility  for their violent actions but denied that the actions were wrong, and  (2) ""excuses,"" in which the young people admitted the act was wrong  but denied responsibility. Every case in the incident database had at  least one physical indicator of force or violence. The  respondent-level file (Part 2) was created from the incident-level  file using the AGGREGATE procedure in SPSS. Variables in Part 1  include the sex, grade, and age of the respondent, the sex and  estimated age of the antagonist, the relationship between respondent  and

The surveys attempt to address many current issues in education, such as preprimary education, school safety and discipline, adult education, and activities related to citizenship. This survey includes two topical survey components: the Adult Education (AE) component, which collected information about adults' participation in adult education, and the Early Childhood Program Participation (ECPP) component, which focused on children's participation in nonparental childcare and early childhood programs. The AE component explored the participation of adults (aged 16 years and older) in a wide range of educational activities during the 12 months prior to the interview. Respondents were asked about their participation in seven broadly-defined types of adult education activities: adult basic skills and GED preparation classes, English As a Second Language instruction, courses taken toward college degrees or vocational diplomas or certificates, apprenticeship programs, career or job-related courses, any other formally structured courses, and computer-only or video-only instruction on the job. The AE component also collected data pertaining to reasons for and barriers to participation in adult education. In all, 19,722 adult interviews were completed: 11,713 with adult education participants and 8,009 with n
onparticipants. The ECPP component examined children's early experiences in various types of nonparental childcare arrangements and early childhood programs. The core of this survey collected extensive information on children's participation and experiences in four types of nonparental care and programs: care by relatives (not including parents), care by nonrelatives, Head Start programs, and other center-based programs. Other information collected in this component concerned children's kindergarten and primary school experiences, children's personal and household demographic characteristics, parent/guardian characteristics, literacy-related home activities, and children's health and disability status. In total, interviews were completed for 14,064 children who were newborn through age 10 and in 3rd grade and below. This includes interviews for 4,135 infants and toddlers, 3,431 preschool children, 1,680 kindergarten children, 4,717 primary school children, and 101 home-schooled children."

The surveys attempt to address many current issues in education, such as preprimary education, school safety and discipline, adult education, and activities related to citizenship. This survey included two topical survey components: Parent/Family Involvement in Education (PFI) and Adult and Youth Civic Involvement (CI). The PFI component, which elicited information from parents and children aged 3 years through grade 12, focused on four areas: types and frequency of family involvement in children's schools, communication with teachers or other school personnel, children's homework and behavior, and learning activities with children outside of school. Other information collected for this component pertained to student experiences at school, children's personal and demographic characteristics, household characteristics, and children's health and disability status. The PFI information is provided in Part 1, Parent and Family Involvement in Education and Civic Involvement -- Parent Data. The CI component of the survey gathered information on civic participation, sources of information about government issues, and knowledge and attitudes about government. Items were administered to youths in grades 6 through 12 (Part 2, Youth Civic Involvement Data)
and their parents, as well as to a representative sample of United States adults (Part 3, Adult Civic Involvement Data). The CI component also addressed opportunities for youth to develop personal responsibility and skills that would facilitate their taking an active role in civic life. CI questions were also asked of the parents surveyed in the PFI component, and these data also can be found in Part 1. In addition to the two major topical components, a screener component of the survey collected demographic and educational information on all members in every household contacted, regardless of whether anyone in the household was selected for an extended interview. (The term ""extended interview"" refers to the interviews completed in the topical components of the study, i.e., the Parent PFI/CI, the Youth CI, or the Adult CI interviews.) Items on the use of public libraries by the household were also administered in the screener portion for households without Parent PFI/CI extended interviews and in the first Parent PFI/CI interview in households in which one or more children were sampled.

Initial questions examined respondents' confidence in the American justice system, their opinions on what they believed were the prosecution's and defense's strongest pieces of evidence, and whether they believed O.J. Simpson to be guilty or not guilty. Respondents were also asked in the initial survey how closely they followed the trial and whether the lawyers and Judge Lance Ito behaved properly during the trial. In the call-back portion of this survey, respondents were queried as to whether they agreed with the not-guilty verdict and whether they believed the jury spent enough time in deliberations. They were also queried as to whether the Simpson trial would make them less or more likely to serve on a jury and whether television had made a difference in the outcome. Respondents were asked for their opinions on the criminal justice system in general and whether it was biased for or against Blacks.

National Center for Education Statistics,"The purpose of this data collection was to provide a more  accurate measure of the racial/ethnic enrollment in postsecondary  institutions in the United States than was previously available. The  National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects racial/ethnic  enrollment data from higher education institutions on an annual  basis. Some institutions do not report these data, and their  ""unknown"" categories have previously been distributed in direct  proportion to the ""knowns."" This resulted in lower than accurate  figures for the racial/ethnic categories. With the advent of the  Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), NCES has  attempted to eliminate this problem by distributing all ""race/ethnicity  unknown"" students through a two-stage process. First, the differences  between reported totals and racial/ethnic details were allocated on a  gender and institutional basis by distributing the differences in  direct proportion to reported distributions. The second-stage  distribution was designed to eliminate the remaining instances of  ""race/ethnicity unknown"". The procedure was to accumulate the  reported racial/ethnic total enrollments by state, level, control, and  gender, calculate the percentage distributions, and apply these  percentages to the reported total enrollments of institutional  respondents (in the same state, level, and control) that did not  supply race/ethnicity detail. In addition, the original ""race/ethnicity  unknown"" data were also left unaltered for those who wish to review the  numbers actually distributed. The racial/ethnic status was broken down  into nonresident alien, Black non-Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan  Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and White non-Hispanic.  There are five data files. Part 1, Institutional Characteristics, includes  variables on control and level of institution, religious affiliation,  highest level of offering, Carnegie classification, and state FIPS code  and abbreviation.

Part 3, Adjusted Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity, includes summary enrollment  data by adjusted race/ethnicity and sex of student and by level and year  of study of student. The ""race/ethnicity unknown"" category data were  distributed across all known race categories in this file. Also, race   data were imputed for institutions that did not report enrollment by race.

These data enable research on topics such as electoral behavior, the political characteristics of local community context, electoral geography, the role of minority groups in elections and legislative redistricting, split ticket voting and divided government, and elections under federalism. One set of files (Part 3, PRECINCT directory, consisting of 205 SPSS portable files) includes every election at and above state House, along with party registration and other variables, in each state for the roughly 170,000 precincts nationwide (about 60 times the number of counties). Another set of files (Part 4, MCDGRP directory, 52 SPSS portable files) has added to these roughly 30-40 political variables an additional 3,725 variables merged from the 1990 United States Census for 47,327 aggregate units called MCD groups. The MCD group is a construct for purposes of this data collection. It is based on a merging of the electoral precincts and Census Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs). A MCD is about the size of a city or town. A MCD group is smaller than or equal to a county and (except in California) is greater than or equal to the size of a MCD. The MCD group units completely tile the United States landmass. The program used to create the MCD group level is also included as part of this collection, as well as the input and output files. This collection also includes geographic boundary files (found in the BOUNDS directory, Part 2) so users can easily draw maps with these data.

Information collected in 1980 (Wave I) focused on the effects of wives' participation in the labor force on marriage and marital instability. Measures predicting marital instability and divorce and assessing marital quality were developed. Variables include information on earnings, commitment to work, hours worked, and occupational status. The focus of Wave II, conducted in 1983, was to link changes in factors such as economic resources, wife's employment, presence of children, marital satisfaction, life goals, and health to actions intended to dissolve a marriage, such as divorce and permanent separation. Information on adjustment to marital dissolution, relationship with in-laws, size of home, parents' employment, use of free time, club membership, child-care arrangements, and responsibility for chores was gathered. Wave III, collected in 1988, further examined the impact of changes in employment, economics, and health on marital relationships. Questions were asked about divorce and remarriage, investment of energy and resource use in the care of aging parents and dependent offspring, asset value, awareness of aging, mental health issues, and history of disease. In 1992, a fourth wave of data was collected to look at changes in employment, economics, and health. Questions were asked about retirement issues, family structure, and the impact of caring for aging parents while at the same time caring for dependent offspring. Data were also collected in 1992 and 1994 from adult offspring who were living in the household in 1980 and had reached age 19 by 1992, thus providing parallel measures with their parents regarding the quality of parent-child relationships, attitudes, and support along with exploring the impact of childhood experiences on the transition to adult life. In 1997, the fifth wave was collected and interviews were conducted with a second sample of adult offspring (N=202) along with second interviews of offspring selected in 1992 (N=606). Wave 5 also examines the relationship between marital quality and
stability and how it relates to changes in marital quality later in life. Among the variables included in all five waves are age, sex, educational attainment, marital status and history, attitude toward divorce, number of children, religious affiliation, and income level."
